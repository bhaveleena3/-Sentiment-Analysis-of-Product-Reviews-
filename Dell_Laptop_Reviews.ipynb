Final Verdict: A Must-Have for Professionals In conclusion, the Dell 7440 is more than just a laptop; it\\'s a productivity powerhouse that fits seamlessly into both work and personal life. I wholeheartedly recommend this machine to anyone looking for a perfect blend of style and performance. Time to set a new standard, starting with my own workspace. All as promised and good so far The delivery communication, timing, packaging, and completeness was great and exactly as promised. The LT was ready to go with Win 11 as soon as I pulled it out. I know other companies are sending with Win 10 and making the customer do the upgrade. Impression of LT so far - great performance and I love how light it is. Really liking the new Latitude 7440 Suprisingly fast and the touchscreen is very responsive. Better than older models. Great for business and Personal use! Works very well. Have not had any difficulty Latitude 7440 Light and powerful, the screen looks bright and sharp. Latitude 7440 great choice Very powerful laptop. Easy setting and installation. Great performance. Solid build and good performance The overall build of the laptop feels solid which I like, doesn\\'t feel flimsy. Keyboard and mouse pad are responsive and pleasant to use (as far as laptop keyboards/mice go). So far performance is good, the i7 processor definitely has the machine running smoothly, time will tell after it gets a pile of Windows updates though! It has an adequate amount of ports compared to other new devices, 2 thunderbolt (one for charging), HDMI and 2 USB. Overall, I like the design and use of the latitude so far, it\\'s also very quiet in normal use (haven\\'t really tested it with any resource hungry applications just yet), so hoping it will continue to run like this and give me a few years of enjoyable use! Great thin and light powerhouse for discerning business users 14\" is the new 13\" -- get these laptops with the ultralight configuration including the 5MP webcam and your users will love you (caveat there is not fingerprint reader on the ultralight). We were using XPS 13 because our exec team wanted something thin and light after using Surface Laptops for years. The keyboards are excellent, configurability is great, repairability looks great after opening one up. Best of all - we have HDMI and a USB-A port again. IS Support Tech. This laptop is the best performer I have used in a laptop in a long time. Perfect on long flights with hours of battery usage. It s fast and easy to travel with given its size and weight. I don t leave home without it. Beautifullly functional simplistically elegant A power house of productivity housed in a cutting edge design. Small but powerful Fast little performer! Lightweight and compact! Travel friendly. Feels great, quality item! Dell 7440 Very lightweight and compact. Respectable performance and features. Slick Little Laptop Small compact laptop but with a solid feel to it. Only drawback was it doesn\\'t have a NIC port onboard but that\\'s a $10 fix if you find you need to plug in. Otherwise it looks like it will stand up to heavy daily use.

Dell Latitude 7440 GTCO (not BTX version) My GTCO version of the Latitude 7440 is excellent. It is light with a responsive keyboard, necessary chip and plug-in options. It turns on automatically when opened using facial recognition and is ready to use in a very short amount of time. The BTX version of the the Latitude 7440 was returned to Dell as it did not come with the requested and required options. Laptops We use the 74x0 laptops throughout our office. We had some issues with the 7420 but they seem to have been cleared up with this latest model. Does what it says Fast with 32GB of RAM. Works well. Zero issues connecting to everything I do. best Business Class Laptop a Feather with better performance.... Outstanding laptop so far So far this laptop is working great. It\\'s comparable to a Surface device. It\\'s lightweight, screen looks great, keyboard is extremely nice and easy to type on. The trackpad feels amazing. It has a great battery life. No complaints so far even though its still too early to tell. Solid chassis, well constructed. Very nice. Solid chassis. I would definitley purchase more. Only negative, this one didn\\'t have the presence detection. I will have to investigate if that is an option. Good item & New color! Sold quality although it seems a bit smaller Dell 7440 Solid unit. Does whats asked of it. Another Great Dell Product This is a great product. I can\\'t recommend Dell enough. There business products, have for the most part, been amazing systems. A Dell user for the last 30 years. Power and Speed in a small package I am really amazed at home much speed, size, and functionality this laptop squeezes into such a small, lightweight package. When I first picked it up I was concerned due to it being so light. I figured it had to have scrimped on something. I was wrong. The screen is bright and fast, as is the processor. The speed of bootup with the solid state drive is fantastic. The keyboard feedback is excellent. My only complaint is simply the large size of the mouse pad. I am not used to it yet and keep touching it at the wrong times as I type. But that should fade as I get used to it. Great laptop. LOOK AT THIS REVIEW Great laptop. Fast. Sometimes slow to start up great for investigation great product for the job at hand Excellent base platform We use this as our standard user platform, and it provides enough power for a very diverse workload.

The higher quality chassis is incredibly light and durable, has a great look, awesome screen, and great specs for the price. We\\'ve only got a few in the hands of users but they all are incredibly happy with the devices compared to the other brand we were using. Best for the price These models seem to last and are well built Great business laptop Lightning fast. very easy to get set up Earl Pedersen Financial Advisor Securian Financial delivery was 8 days earlier than their estimate!!! Excellent laptop with exceptional battery life This laptop came with a 10 core processor (2 Power cores, 8 Efficiency cores), 32 GB of RAM, and a 500 GB NVMe drive. The 14\" screen (non-touch) is easy to read, bright, and a comfortable size. I set the scale to 150% to accommodate my old eyes. The keyboard and touch pad work and feel great. I set up the system to log me in with both facial recognition and with a fingerprint. Facial recognition works surprisingly well in low light. The only time it didn\\'t work was outside, with the Sun shining on the camera. Speaking of the camera, the video, audio, and microphone worked well in remote meetings. It has a useful set of ports: Two USB-C, two USB-A, one HDMI, and one old-style headphone jack. Both USB-C ports are capable of powering this computer. I connected three 27\" monitors to this laptop at the same time, and it handled them nicely. Two were connected to a docking station on one of the laptop\\'s USB-C port, and the third monitor was connected directly to the other port. I tested gaming on it. The video adapter is purely Intel. I tried playing No Man\\'s Sky on it. It was playable, but not a great experience. I wouldn\\'t recommend this laptop for gaming, though it wasn\\'t designed or marketed for that, so that\\'s fair. I made a drive image backup, then installed both Debian 12 and Ubuntu 22.04 on it. Both systems worked very well on this laptop, with the exception of the built in web cam, which seems to lack Linux drivers at this time. I did a drive speed test, which resulted in around 3800 MB/sec read speed. Wow! That\\'s the fastest NVMe drive I have ever used, so I was thoroughly impressed. The battery life on this machine is very impressive. It is hard to give a single answer on how many hours to expect, as it depends on what load it is under. It varies between 7 hours and 20 hours, depending on what I\\'m doing. I\\'m confident it would make it through an entire work day under normal use, so I give it high marks for battery life. I would definitely recommend this computer for anything except gaming, and will definitely consider it for future business purchases. Great workhorse Fantastic responsive and light Great system and nice hardware Over all the laptop is very powerful and great hardware in a small sleek profile. I do still have issue with the trackpad but that is more a windows issue than dell. Glad to see previous conserns have been addresses in this model. Excellent laptop Love the size and speed of the laptop. It runs all of our programs easily and the screen is easy on the eyes. Dell 7440: a laptop for lawyers A super quick piece of kit with capacity to add 3 big Dell monitors using my power dock. I m a lawyer and I work from the office, the courts and from home. This little system adapts to any environment I work in, especially when I use my virtual desktop. The connection is so fast it s just like being there. It packs a huge punch for its 14 inch profile. A laptop that understands the needs of lawyers. Incredible laptop Use this laptop for work. Its so good I had to get one for myself. Great product The Latitude 7440 gives my sales team everything they need. Compact, touch screen, long battery life, great performance. This is our 4th generation of Latitude laptops and Dell continues to improve the product. Please maintain these standards of improvement and keep latitude a brand that I can trust. Great device at a great price. Great computer, super quick with the next generation Intel processor! This laptop is a beast! this laptop is a beast. IT has everything a gamer wants and needs. Great Laptop The 7440 XCTO is light weight, fast and the screen looks great. I love the light up keyboard and fingerprint reader. The sound is excellent, the trackpad is large and responsive and if you accidently rest your hand on it, it doesn\\'t go crazy. It doesn\\'t get crazy hot when charging or when using it so it is comfortable to use on your lap. It flips over to tablet mode without having to disconnect the keyboard which is convenient so you don\\'t have to worry about misplacing the keyboard and you still have access to all the ports. There is a strong magnet on the side to hold the pen. Other laptops that I have used that had this feature had weak magnets that made losing the pen a real possibility. The styling is generic Dell which is actually ok as it makes it less flashy and less prone to theft. Overall a great laptop at a good price. 10 out of 10, would buy again. Well designed, powerful compact laptop This laptop is terrific. Dell really has stepped it up and continues to impress. The thin form factor is so incredibly lightweight. Don\\'t be deceived by it\\'s small size as it packs a punch. The processor is super fast and it is very snappy. It has all of the ports that I need for business and the battery lasts and lasts. The screen clarity and camera quality make working a breeze. The keys are comfortable and feel nice as you type. The touchpad is large and useful. I love the power button towards the top right. The color is a beautiful deep blue which looks sharp. College Student Review This laptop is very nice, its the perfect weight and dimensions, making it a great laptop to carry around. The keyboard is very nice and the keys are smooth to type on. The only thing that I found difficult was figuring out how to put shortcuts for apps on the computer onto the desktop, but that might just be a feature of Windows. Excellent Laptop A very fine laptop. More than accommodates my needs. Dell 7440 - What\\'d not to like? What\\'s not to like? i find the screen and keyboard to be and excellent and efficient UI. the keyboard allows the user to type at their best speed; the OS is intuitive. A great workhorse for keeping up with increasing demand to do more in less time.

Latitude 7440 Great small form rugged laptop Lightweight, fast, perfect I\\'m loving my new laptop. The speeds, lightweight and ease of use are perfect Happy Latitude 7440 Owner Rock solid hardware with a beautiful display. Great laptop upgrade! The laptop is performing great. Love the new color of the new 7440. Premium feel and love the venting location. The additional screen resolution is a great add to increase productivity. Great performances T his one really delivers. Pleanty RAM and Processor speed. Lightweight, compact, yet powerful I have never been a fan of Dell products in the past, as I always imagined them to be too bulky and heavy for my tastes (and my back!) but I was quite pleased by this laptop. Being used to the triangle of laptop quality (power /style /weight), I was surprised to find that it actually solves for all three. Well played, Dell - I ll have to keep you in consideration when I update my gaming rig, in case you ve improved that area as well. April Farrah at Dell is the best she handle Great laptop, very fast and responsive, no complaints 7440 Aluminum Solid build and elegant color.

Latitude 7440 Review Latitude 7440 is a great laptop to use for everyday tasks. 2 in 1 feature makes it very versatile for any kind of task I need to do. Performance is good and the size/weight makes it easy to carry. Get the best - this is it. Super fast, great screen. When working from a computer, get the best. This is it. Great laptop! The 7440 has a great feel, love the aluminum casing. Super fast with the 13th gen processor. Flagship done right! This is the most well executed laptop model that Dell has released in a while. They clearly took the best features from the precision line, and what people wanted from previous Latitude models and put it together to create an amazing device that\\'s capable and lightweight at the same time. The 7440 has everything my company needs for an executive end user, it\\'s got 5G, 13th gen Intel, 32GB of ram, a QHD Matte display, a decent webcam, and powerful speakers, in a very light and small form factor. If I had to pick a windows laptop that closely compares to a m1 MacBook pro, this would be it.

Light & compact, powerful enough for all my computing needs without breaking my back! Great Laptop!! Light Weight, Fast and great battery life! Highly recommend! It is very sleek and nice to work with. The touch screen isn\\'t a bother and is great once I need it. The battery life is very long and the keyboard has an amazing sound as well. Best laptop of 5 previous laptop computers I have owned! This laptop is the perfect combination of power, I7 with 16GB memory, keyboard key size and feel plus it is touch screen. It is equipped with a fingerprint reader and I know this saves me at least 20 minutes every day and I don\\'t have to remember the passkey. I power two 28\" external monitors and I am using the Dell Thunderbolt Dock which also charges the Latitude 7440\\'s batteries all thru one thunderbolt connection. The laptop ran about 8 hours of heavy use on its internal batteries alone. It is processing Camtasia video renderings about 20% faster that my other 5 year old Dell laptop G7 which is also an I7 with 16GB of memory. Not one issue with the 7440 or the docking station. Love this machine. Great travel workstation My wife needed a new work system and this is the one she went with. It works great, its light and powerful. It acts as a personal workstation at home and easy to travel laptop while she is on the go Dir IT it works well with the large keyboard including a keypad for financial. My favorite Latitude model to date I\\'ve been fortunate enough to try out all of the new \\'40\\' series laptops and this is by far my favorite. It\\'s not too large and not too small, as the 14\" screen is just right for performing daily tasks. The best enhancement besides the latest processor in this series is the speakers as they now throw the sound up whereas in the past they\\'d throw it downwards, so hearing audio on this newer model is much better than in the past. I\\'ll probably be buying many of these within the near future. New Latitude 7440 Laptop Light and powerful. Screen is excellent. Docking is simple, just one USB-C connection and you are good to go. Solid executive class laptop Nice premium 2-in-1 laptop New Dell Latitude 7440 Laptops The Dell Latitude 7440 laptop is a really nice laptop, bright screen, easy to setup and configure. Our users are very happy with them. Ordering and Delivery were much faster than expected. Big power, big screen! The 7440 is a very premium product. I\\'m really happy about the move to a 16:10 aspect ratio. The world was 16:9 for a long time due to movies... but that\\'s not really what this device is for. From a productivity standpoint, the additional vertical space is extremely useful. Excellent!!!! Excellent laptop. Lightweight and powerful Ultralight, portable 2 and 1 laptop 13th gen is perfect for multi-tasking, perfect for my needs. 14\" touch screen, great speakers with IR cam perfect for Windows Hello. Great model-year revisions! Thrilled with the changes in the 7440 series--the Ultralight chassis and changes to cooling/ventilation placement, as well as the addition of another USB-A port, are all hits with our clients. Thanks! Near perfect for corporations and enthusiasts Near perfect option for corporations and enthusiasts. We have pretty powerful and efficient cpu paired with fast ddr5, nvme drive, touch screen. Extremely lightweight - excellent ubuntu support. Good Light laptop Good Light laptop. slight improvements from the 7420\\'s i\\'m hoping the improved the USB-C connector to be a bit more resilient to wear and tear from the overly large USB-C connector on the docking stations. Device tested was well built and performed well. All round a good corporate device Device tested was well built and performed well. All round a good corporate device My 13 Year Old Daughter\\'s New 2in1 Laptop I am very happy with the service provided by Dell. Initially the wrong model was sent, however it was quickly and courteously exchanged for the correct one and the money I initially paid was promptly refunded as soon as the original (incorrect) model reached Dell\\'s Sydney NSW office. We reside a long way away from Sydney in regional QLD thus the turnaround time was very impressive. My daughter is of course, extremely happy with her new 2in1 technology and it\\'s the first time either of us had ever seen or used Windows 11. It\\'s very intuitive and easier to navigate than its Windows 10 predecessor. The laptop itself has the latest Intel 13th Gen Core i7 processor and 16 GB memory and is extremely fast. Great Performance Jump! Great Laptop with the chance to add a better performance CPU (i7 1370p). I recommend to also add the new 5mp camera and 400 nits screen for a perfect combo. Program Manager Employee is very satisfied with laptop. Exceptional performance and build quality for the price! Exceptional performance and build quality for the price! Great Laptop Been a Dell user for over 20 years, and their Latitude range never disappoints. Beautiful design, super-fast, secure and love the extra security features with Dell Optimiser Robust Very robust laptop, very quick and battery lasts a long time. Dell Latitude 7440 XCTO Excellent unit! Really enjoying the performance, display, thermal control (low heat), and battery life(very good). Trackpad has a very nice feel as well. Overall, very pleased with the unit. If I had to make one small nitpick, I would just mention the keyboard itself feels a bit lower quality than the rest of the outstanding ultralight hardware build. Still an excellent system overall. Perfect business laptop Smooth large touchpad and comfortable keyboard. lots of port options for connectivity without needing to carry extra dongles Great Device Great device, fast and worth the money. Impressive 2-in-1 Impressive 2-in-1. Nice configuration options. Speed, power,and durability are built into this laptop. Great Business Laptop Improvements to cooling and speaker configuration. great new product ! I received my Dell 7440 as I was having problems with a less powerful unit and it has been great so far, very responsive and sems to have resolved my issues. I\\'m no tech head but I sell these to my customers, and it is great to really know why people choose Dell. Reliable, well built and a company that backs their products. You got to love it! Dell Latitude 7440 Rating We\\'ve had no issues with the Dell Latitude 7440 thus far. We have been able to put them in the hands of our users with our standard image with no issue, Great standard for business. Very nice standard machine. Compact & Lightweight Nice and small - size is perfect and lightweight Latitude 7440 Review for business user Love the feel and weight of the laptop but the processor seems a bit slower than I expected. Nice laptop with good features I haven\\'t used it for very long and it is replacing an older XPS13. So far it performs well and the additional inch in the screen is nice. Having the power button in the normal keyboard field is going to take some time to become accustomed to. I use the laptop connected to a docking station and would like to have USB-C ports on both sides of the laptop. With them only on the left the dock cable has to run around to the far side and the Dell dock cables are short. It\\'s troublesome but less so than changing to have the laptop on the righthand side of the desktop monitors. The speakers work pretty well. I like the placement so stereo sound is effective. The camera is pretty wide angled and has a good image. Its clunkier than my 7200 model, but otherwise good Its clunkier than my 7200 model, but otherwise good Great machine but requires much configuration Excellent performance. Initial setup was abysmal however. BIOS was all screwed up and required siginficant configuration before the laptop would boot into auto setup mode for Windows. The default mouse settings are FAR too sensitive. In general the default configuration for settings are WAY too conservative and thus far too much time is spent getting the laptop into a real world usable configuration. Nice Blue, Nice Weight New blue color looks nice, ultralight model offers noticeable weight reduction, but not by a lot Sleek & Powerful Product is sleek and great performance. very convenient for day to day work style. Highly recommend Laptop works great. We needed a solid laptop for the field that had 5g. This ticked every box. We also purchased the dock which works great as well. So far so good. So far we\\'ve had great results with this laptop. It seems Dell has ironed out some of the ssd and driver issues with the past couple of generations. Bluetooth The Bluetooth sometimes doesn\\'t work or will connect to the device but not for the audio but other than that I love it! Mouse and Power off button Speed and memory power excellent. But the mouse sensitivity is too fast, and the function to slow it down does not work. Also the off power button next to the delete button is ridiculous! Latitude 7440 Good laptop but battery don\\'t last long. Not good for travel. Good product for executive people\\'s. The review details are as follows with rating out of 10. Design - 8 Hardware - 10 Ports - 8 Display - 9 Performance - 9 Battery - 9 WebCAM - 9 Audio - 9 Overall the product is good with a rating of 8 out of 10 and the price of value is 7 out of 10. Windows 11P Tough network start up with windows 11P big step major change on design and materials Latitude 7440 Laptop review Sleek design, enhanced webcam. Hopefully the processor and RAM ensure smooth multitasking. Okay The product was okay first few weeks..once you open excel...it hangs and hangs...Too slow to respond..Main reason for directly ftom Dell site is the quality of the product..I think, it was a wrong choice.. Latitude 7440 Laptop fits client needs perfectly Latitude 7440 The weight and features of the device are pleasant and align with other modern specs for PCs. The camera quality, while nice to include IR compatibility with Windows Hello, still feels like a \"laptop camera\" instead of a true \"webcam\". Low light performance is still limited and it would be nice to see a 4K upgrade. The weight of the laptop makes it extremely portable; however, the plastic materials make it also feel flimsy, as if carrying it loftily from a desk to a couch would risk breaking it if not fully supported with both hands or gripped by the spine instead of an edge. The screen looks good and does not seem to contribute much to eye fatigue and the keyboard and trackpad seem appropriately responsive. Boot up time is quick, as expected, and performing standard productivity workflows like web browsing, document editing, and video conferencing is smooth without noticable interference from the hardware. The available security features for enterprise-level management seem broad, although I have not fully explored those yet. Altogether this is a nice daily-driver that can fit a variety of standard workloads and workflows. Great performance and design Great performance and design A decent device that is well built and powerful. The review is for the laptop version of the 7440 and not the 2-in-1. It\\'s a decent laptop, not the largest of screen sizes but what it lacks in size, it packs in power and functionality. Backlit keyboard is nice and responsive, the IR webcam is quick and picks up facial recognition really well and is obviously Windows Hello ready. The laptop also has fingerprint recognition capabilities but I haven\\'t tested it. The screen is good and looks like it has some sort of anti-reflective film which drastically reduces glare and really usable in sunny or bright light areas. The speakers are fantastic, great sound and where they are positioned on either side, you do get the sense of some surround sound but don\\'t expect it to be 5.1 or 7.1, these are still speakers built into a laptop with little depth, but you could easily do without headphones when listening to music or watching video content. The weight is fine and it isn\\'t the thinnest of laptops but that does mean you do get more than just 2 USB-C ports, you get HDMI & standard USB ports, which is great because you don\\'t have to carry around a portable docking station for extra ports. There is one thing that I don\\'t like much but think it was built by design. When you open the lid and fold it back beyond the upright 90 degree\\'s the bottom of the lid pushes down on the flat surface which gives a little lift to the keyboard, which is a nice touch for those that like some elevation of their keyboard. The downside to this is that the edge of the monitor scraps the surface as you are rotate the screen and therefore could damage the edge if the surface isn\\'t flat and smooth or clean. I also took the opportunity to play some games as well, just to see how well it faired without a dedicated GPU. Played Fornite and it was a little stuttery with the settings at near high quality, reduced it down to mid-level visual quality and it was very playable. Not advocating that this laptop is in anyway a gaming laptop because it isn\\'t, I was purely demostrating the capabilities of this laptop. Dell Latitude 7440 XCTO review Computer received in good order and works fine after setting up. Latitude 7440 - impressive impressive laptop, fairly thin, lightweight and very capable machine. This is a workhorse of a laptop which we intend to use for the majority of our business needs outside of engineering Great Improvement from the older model... Sleek look and fast performance. The touch pad is great. It has a very good screen. On the whole, a very happy experience. Excellent product Great product, works well but bit heavy to carry around Dell Review Overall, I do really like the laptop and happy I went with a Dell vs Mac this time. I do wish they offered a touchscreen for the price I paid. Also, does have some lag to it when I am multitasking. Good business laptop with familiarity of previous model Nice lighter laptop no info of new features so not sure of what to look for with the upgrade outside the usual battery and speed. Seems to be a smooth transition from one to the other and very familiar but modern. Great Fit Works exactly as expected. Great laptop with a questionable touch pad These are great laptops, and they recently added a second USB-A connector which is a massive improvement (ONE was ridiculous). The only issue is for some reason the track pad buttons don\\'t appear to work 100% of the time - more like 90-95%, which is sufficient to make you think they\\'re good enough to use and just bad enough to be incredibly annoying. Reasonably light, reasonably small, and more than powerful enough for the vast majority of users. Use a Bluetooth mouse and the button issue becomes a nothing-burger. Perfect in business category Good performance, little bit design is disappointed Speedy performance machine, could use a bigger screen and better speakers This laptop is built very well and sturdy. It is lightweight and easy to carry around. The keys are relatively quiet. The performance is speedy and there is no delay throughout the day. The camera is up to date and crystal clear. Sound levels of the speakers could be higher, but still decent for a laptop. Screen size is a bit on the tiny side, but does work well and look good. Great Business Laptop The device works great. Only reason to not give it 5 stars is the weight. Punch Small, compact, but throws a good punch. You\\'ll look like a corporate drone. But it gets the job done. Perfectly fine, but not very exciting. Everything is functional but just average. Surprisingly heavily. Great professional laptop Great professional laptop. This thing is thin and light weight but also does not get hot. Perfect lightweight laptop Really nice lightweight laptop capable of 32gb internal memory for business users running Bloomberg and multiple Excel sheets with ease. The computer For engineering school, I hope that this computer will be what I need for aerospace engineering! Looks promise you! Very Good Small, light, and powerful Slim & Sleek Looks very sleek, however, they have not been used yet. Quality of build & Dell Migrate tools great Found the built quality very good. Used the Dell Migrate tools and went well Easy order and setup Easy order process and easy setup. I\\'m glad to have this up and running fo. Sleek lightweight powerhouse Nice little computer. Came loaded with a Microsoft office suite all set up which was nice. I still need to transfer my various softwares over to it. Very sleek and lightweight. I like the backlit keys. dfbdfd the PO process can be made easier One of the best work computers made by Dell; more power efficient processors make the hardware even better Nice laptop, good weight and sturdiness. The keyboard and touchpad are some of the best Dell has made yet. I wish there was a more affordable option for a higher-resolution screen, but I\\'m sure that will come. Price is good for what you get and the battery life is pretty great. Most of our users can get 6-8 hours without charging from a new device. Obviously that will get shorter over time, but it\\'s a good starting point. A lot of this is made possible by the newer 13-generation Intel processors, which are finally, FINALLY getting to a point where they\\'re not causing heat issues and fans running constantly. If Intel continues to have their processors follow a less power-hungry model, this will only improve. Latitude 7440 I purchased a Dell Latitude 7440 about 2 weeks ago after looking at many laptops but decided to purchased online for simplicity and it was delivered within 3 days as stated. Easy to setup straight out of the box but it has taken me a little while to get use to the new windows layout. All in all its a great little PC, solid and fast, it does everything i want in a travel laptop. Good build quality, small enough to fit in a backpack but powerful enough to do workshop presentations, spreadsheets or stream a movie. I wasn\\'t sure about not having a network connection built in or if i could plug in all my accessories but so far i\\'ve had no problems and once i got everything copied across i haven\\'t looked back. My biggest problem is i now have to update all my other accessories to match the new PC. It is only early days but i\\'m feeling confident as it came with a 3 year warranty. Good lightweight business-grade laptop let down by some of the included Dell business software. The laptop build is solid and thermal\\\\heat management is pretty good also. The only reason why I didn\\'t give it a 5 star rating is some of the software components that needs improvement, specifically the Dell Optimiser application that comes with the laptop. I tried using it for about 2 weeks and it\\'s quite buggy with regards to auto-monitoring the quality video\\\\audio conferencing calls and the \"on-looker\" detection functionality. It needs improvement and I have disabled that functionality for now. Lightweight, portable with all necessary ports. The USB C port needs to be receded into the bevel to keep it from moving and becoming wobbly. This is the main point of failure for these when using docking stations. Lightweight and low heat generated, very impressive. The USB C port needs to be receded into the bevel to keep it from moving and becoming wobbly. This is the main point of failure for these when using docking stations. Great Business Machine! the larger trackpad takes some getting used to coming from the 7290, but this unit is fast and a great upgrade Dell 7440 review Our company is considering switching over to Dell laptops from a different brand. So far, we\\'ve been impressed with the build quality and overall features of the laptop. So far, the 2 biggest \"complaints\" have been the separation, or lack of separation, of the backspace and Enter key and the wide angle view of the integrated camera. Both are minor, and if these are the things that users are sharing for feedback, I\\'d say that this is a great machine. Dell Latituded 7440 XCTO Nice size. Great screen quality. Login proctections are good. Only downside is there is no privacy screen nor an easy way to print screen. Ergonomic review USB-C port and HDMI port all on the left side of the laptop, not convenient DELL vs MAC This is a very nice beefy machine. It\\'s very comparable to the MacBook. Good Product but a step backwards in feel. Functionality and speed are excellent. The negative is that this device no longer has a premium feel without the carbon fiber and feels like the same plastic product you get with a 5440. Latitude 7440 - Another Dell success story (thus far) Nicely designed frame, sleek and solid, very contemporary. High-contrast screen makes interaction a breeze, even after hours of continual use. Solid touch-response from the keyboard. Processing power (thus far) is substantial, with good performance ratings across a number of benchmark apps. Typical complete suite of supportive tools and features that promise to provide reduced start-up time, increase battery life and help to prioritize functionality of oft-used apps. Security features are well designed for the typical office environment, with the ability to grey-out the screen if the system notices someone looking over your shoulder. Evaluation continues; no notable deficiencies found thus far. This appears to be another quality Dell product, thus far. More durable Much better than the 5xxx series, the aluminum shell seems more durable, I have so many scratched laptops from the 53xx and 54xx series that i can\\'t reuse them. I am hoping the case on the 7440 is longer lasting for our Green-IT initiative. No surprises in a good way Does everything we needed it to. Laptop Review Super laptop, fast. Bit of trouble with camera causing windows crash but the newest bios and camera software fixed the problem. Fast and lightweight Fast, lightweight, runs cool. Great Machine The battery life on this device is awesome. I don\\'t have to worry about plugging it in every couple of hours. Using the 2-1 with the Dell Pen is great for taking notes. My only negative is it is a little heavy to carry around and work on for more than 30ish minutes. High performing, light-weight system The Dell Latitude 7440 is tremendously responsive, delivering great performance in a light-weight package. Very Nice Very nice. Only negative was all the crap ware that comes pre installed. Dell always needs an option to get a clean machine. At least it didnt have Norton! Great Laptop! Great laptop that I use to work from home. Screen size is perfect and love the flexibility to move around the house without dropping wifi. The only minor issue is for about a month, it would blue screen every so often (once every couple of weeks) but that seems to be resolved after applying updates. I get a lot of use out of this laptop and would recommend it. Fast, light and quick laptop If fast, light and feels durable. I like the older models case better though. Not as good as last Dell purchase Less than happy with with the individual that i bought this through, now having frustartions with tech support User Friendly Very user friendly. Love it Needs memory to function like a workstation PC came with 16GB of memory and to be honest, it quickly causes lag on the box. I have a lot of open tabs for the internet and I have to do a lot of closing of apps and tabs to work. Does not work Not happy with latitude 7040. Also doking station thunder bolt does not work with the laptops Great Laptop great choice for laptop upgrade for office work Does not want to quit the standby mode My computer works well except it does not want to resume a session after being in stand by mode. I need to turn it off completely before I can use it again. Other wise, it is easy to use, nice looking and I enjoy also windows 11 that is new to me. Just fine! Its a dependable machine. Dell Latitude 7440 XCTO Little flimsy and less ports. Screen is not very crisp. The touch screen was showing some issues right from the box Potential Exec laptop replacement This laptop is *light*, very very light. Which is great from a portability standpoint. We have not have quite long enough to fully judge it\\'s use case regarding the battery life or the software loaded from our company. But I can say that this would likely be a wonderful laptop for support personnel that often travel. I would caution against handing this to any executives that are looking for a \"polished\" machine in regard to the body type. The screen has a bit of flex when closed; not enough to be any concern, but noteworthy. Portable vs Traditional Device is slim and portable. East to setup. Speaker and microphone quality was good for a single user but not good use in a meeting setting. Rear camera worked well but front facing camera wasn\\'t didn\\'t work. not an improvement over the same version from 4 years ago no improvement from the 2019 version of the 7400, hate the mousepad and buttons being integrated into a single pad and not separate buttons, the larger mousepad makes it difficult to type on the keyboard, and an older/slower CPU is actually a downgrade The laptop is great but ordering process went wrong. The purchasing process was very incovenient this time since Dell had to cancel my original PO after few days for some internal issue. Then I had to reorder the laptop again. It created extra work for me and IT team as well as delayed my order. Product came with faulty display Product came with faulty display Unleashing Productivity On-the-Go with the Latitude 7440 The Latitude 7440 has proven to be an invaluable tool for my daily work. Its compact size, combined with its lightweight design, makes it incredibly convenient to carry around, be it in meetings within the office or for on-the-go tasks outside. I\\'ve been particularly impressed with its battery life, which consistently sees me through an entire workday without the need for a recharge. This has been a game-changer for me, allowing uninterrupted work sessions both in and out of the office. For those in search of a reliable and portable work companion, the Latitude 7440 is a commendable choice. Good for entertainment instead of business use Sound: Speakers on both side of keyboard panel is awesome. Power button: Fingerprint recognition is not sensitive Button: Pg down and Pg up buttons too near, keep pressing on the wrong one. Button: Delete and Power button too near, keep pressing on the wrong one. Wi-Fi card: Faulty after 1 week of receiving the new laptop and needs to be replaced with a new one. So so experience with intial use. I had all sorts of trouble with getting software installed (e.g. multiple instances of the Blue Screen of Death) and sorting through hardward issues (e.g., camera working and microphone quality).. BIOS Problem I needed to use an external keyboard to access F2 or F12 Nice laptop, Windows software kept crashing Software arrived defective lightweight and powerful, but does not play nicely with multiple monitors. The laptop is lightweight and powerful, but will not play nicely with Dell wd19 dock with multiple 4k monitors. No EVO Framework I purchased this laptop for personal use because the website filter identified this computer as EVO and VPRO Certified. I also called the sales team numerous times and also used the Chat function with the Sale Department, verifying that this laptop was EVO. EVO certification is important to me because it indicates a better performing laptop and overall computing experience. I am disappointed that I found out that this laptop is not EVO certified and I will be returning it for another one. I have been using Dell products for over a decade and I have been very satisfied with Dell and I would recommend Dell to my friends and family. However, in my particular situation, I was told that I would get a 15% restocking fee if I return the laptop. I have been working with management and I hope this is not the case. The laptop is good and the 36GB makes easy work of my statistical software. If it were EVO certified, like my previous Latitude 7420 model, this would be the perfect business/travel laptop. The device was faulty and facing issues in usage. The device was faulty and facing issues in usage. Device is crashing with blue screen of death with different reasons. Waste Of Money Worst Screen Quality ever on any laptop Dell latitude-14-7440-2-in-1-laptop Significant downgrade in materials quality compare to the previous version 7400. Some parts are showing design flow from new. Please see the picture after use of 1 week from new. Too slow! Waited 5 weeks for the computer. Way too slow! Solid Corporate device This is a great performing device for corporate usage Many complications I received my new dell and it came with many complications and i still cant use it....software updates would not load up, programs refused to fully download on the computer that i needed for my job..and my job\\'s IT dept has been working on it for two weeks now in order to make it a functional computer that i can rely on using. Hate to put a bad review but this is the truth Dead on arrival We have not had good luck with our 7440 s with so far 2 of 10 with failing usbc ports where the motherboards had to be replaced. Good device - poor screen and touch support The device is fast and responsive to most Office applications. It has a solid feel however it is a little heavier than I had expected. I am most disappointed with the touch screen. The clamshell model I have only provides basic touch support and doesn\\'t support active pen(s). Based on the high unit price and poor touch screen support, I struggle to recommend this unit. Rather keep the old Latitude laptop Everything seems to lag when typing from emails, typing in Excel, Word, Teams. Hate this new laptop Need User manual Please send me User Manual for this device, i need to learn to fully utilize the features Sr. Director of IT Business Service I am very pleased with the laptop as it meets my requirements. Fast, lightweight. Blue screen Not a good experience, have been getting the \\'Blue screen of death\\' since last night and doesnt allow me to login even after multiple restarts I don\\'t have it yet. I don\\'t have it yet. Shipping took forever. PDP error the product description website has a bug, for which customer will end up paying for. half the stuff hasnt arrived. half the stuff hasnt arrived. First time in 25 years dispaointed with a Dell Very disapointed with the quality of the new Latitude laptops. A step backword in the design Received a wrong configuration Received a wrong configuration laptop and response is so mean from the sales representative. Not sure if this gets resolved. Horrible Customer Support Never Delivered and Asian order support just keeps saying it was delivered acting like they don\\'t understand and want to put ticket in resolved. No help at all. Still unresolved many days later. Lost in transit and no refund 10 days since I ordered and No laptop. DHL say that they can\\'t find it. Dell keep saying it is being investigated, probably using my money that has not been refunded. Can\\'t log in Unable to log in. Has been with my IT department for over 2 weeks now. Still cannot use Great Laptops, but Quality Control has slipped Ordered 2 laptops, 1 was DOA upon delivery. Unfortunately this was not unique - last order was for 9 laptops, 2 were DOA. Something has seriously gone wrong with Quality Control in the factory. Good news is that Dell Pro Support fixed them without any issues - once parts were available which took a week in each case. Other than that, love these laptops. Faulty motherboard Dell sent me a laptop with a faulty motherboard Dead on arrival Laptop dead on arrival, still waiting on a replacement. Bad Quality Bad Quality, overheating, and keyboard/trackpad issues. Hassles with installation of Win 11 Laptop did not come with the required security software as required by my company Broken Device Laptop is broken and Customer Support is not helpful'"

            "Excellent laptop with exceptional battery life This laptop came with a 10 core processor (2 Power cores, 8 Efficiency cores), 32 GB of RAM, and a 500 GB NVMe drive. The 14\" screen (non-touch) is easy to read, bright, and a comfortable size. I set the scale to 150% to accommodate my old eyes. The keyboard and touch pad work and feel great. I set up the system to log me in with both facial recognition and with a fingerprint. Facial recognition works surprisingly well in low light. The only time it didn't work was outside, with the Sun shining on the camera. Speaking of the camera, the video, audio, and microphone worked well in remote meetings. It has a useful set of ports: Two USB-C, two USB-A, one HDMI, and one old-style headphone jack. Both USB-C ports are capable of powering this computer. I connected three 27\" monitors to this laptop at the same time, and it handled them nicely. Two were connected to a docking station on one of the laptop's USB-C port, and the third monitor was connected directly to the other port. I tested gaming on it. The video adapter is purely Intel. I tried playing No Man's Sky on it. It was playable, but not a great experience. I wouldn't recommend this laptop for gaming, though it wasn't designed or marketed for that, so that's fair. I made a drive image backup, then installed both Debian 12 and Ubuntu 22.04 on it. Both systems worked very well on this laptop, with the exception of the built in web cam, which seems to lack Linux drivers at this time. I did a drive speed test, which resulted in around 3800 MB/sec read speed. Wow! That's the fastest NVMe drive I have ever used, so I was thoroughly impressed. The battery life on this machine is very impressive. It is hard to give a single answer on how many hours to expect, as it depends on what load it is under. It varies between 7 hours and 20 hours, depending on what I'm doing. I'm confident it would make it through an entire work day under normal use, so I give it high marks for battery life. I would definitely recommend this computer for anything except gaming, and will definitely consider it for future business purchases.  :  excellent laptop with exceptional battery life this laptop came with a 10 core processor (2 power cores, 8 efficiency cores), 32 gb of ram, and a 500 gb nvme drive. the 14\" screen (non-touch) is easy to read, bright, and a comfortable size. i set the scale to 150% to accommodate my old eyes. the keyboard and touch pad work and feel great. i set up the system to log me in with both facial recognition and with a fingerprint. facial recognition works surprisingly well in low light. the only time it didn't work was outside, with the sun shining on the camera. speaking of the camera, the video, audio, and microphone worked well in remote meetings. it has a useful set of ports: two usb-c, two usb-a, one hdmi, and one old-style headphone jack. both usb-c ports are capable of powering this computer. i connected three 27\" monitors to this laptop at the same time, and it handled them nicely. two were connected to a docking station on one of the laptop's usb-c port, and the third monitor was connected directly to the other port. i tested gaming on it. the video adapter is purely intel. i tried playing no man's sky on it. it was playable, but not a great experience. i wouldn't recommend this laptop for gaming, though it wasn't designed or marketed for that, so that's fair. i made a drive image backup, then installed both debian 12 and ubuntu 22.04 on it. both systems worked very well on this laptop, with the exception of the built in web cam, which seems to lack linux drivers at this time. i did a drive speed test, which resulted in around 3800 mb/sec read speed. wow! that's the fastest nvme drive i have ever used, so i was thoroughly impressed. the battery life on this machine is very impressive. it is hard to give a single answer on how many hours to expect, as it depends on what load it is under. it varies between 7 hours and 20 hours, depending on what i'm doing. i'm confident it would make it through an entire work day under normal use, so i give it high marks for battery life. i would definitely recommend this computer for anything except gaming, and will definitely consider it for future business purchases.\n",

It doesn't get crazy hot when charging or when using it so it is comfortable to use on your lap.

            "Latitude 7440 The weight and features of the device are pleasant and align with other modern specs for PCs. The camera quality, while nice to include IR compatibility with Windows Hello, still feels like a \"laptop camera\" instead of a true \"webcam\". Low light performance is still limited and it would be nice to see a 4K upgrade. The weight of the laptop makes it extremely portable; however, the plastic materials make it also feel flimsy, as if carrying it loftily from a desk to a couch would risk breaking it if not fully supported with both hands or gripped by the spine instead of an edge. The screen looks good and does not seem to contribute much to eye fatigue and the keyboard and trackpad seem appropriately responsive.

            "A decent device that is well built and powerful. The review is for the laptop version of the 7440 and not the 2-in-1. It's a decent laptop, not the largest of screen sizes but what it lacks in size, it packs in power and functionality. Backlit keyboard is nice and responsive, the IR webcam is quick and picks up facial recognition really well and is obviously Windows Hello ready. The laptop also has fingerprint recognition capabilities but I haven't tested it. The screen is good and looks like it has some sort of anti-reflective film which drastically reduces glare and really usable in sunny or bright light areas. The speakers are fantastic, great sound and where they are positioned on either side, you do get the sense of some surround sound but don't expect it to be 5.1 or 7.1, these are still speakers built into a laptop with little depth, but you could easily do without headphones when listening to music or watching video content. The weight is fine and it isn't the thinnest of laptops but that does mean you do get more than just 2 USB-C ports, you get HDMI & standard USB ports, which is great because you don't have to carry around a portable docking station for extra ports. There is one thing that I don't like much but think it was built by design. When you open the lid and fold it back beyond the upright 90 degree's the bottom of the lid pushes down on the flat surface which gives a little lift to the keyboard, which is a nice touch for those that like some elevation of their keyboard. The downside to this is that the edge of the monitor scraps the surface as you are rotate the screen and therefore could damage the edge if the surface isn't flat and smooth or clean. I also took the opportunity to play some games as well, just to see how well it faired without a dedicated GPU. Played Fornite and it was a little stuttery with the settings at near high quality, reduced it down to mid-level visual quality and it was very playable. Not advocating that this laptop is in anyway a gaming laptop because it isn't, I was purely demostrating the capabilities of this laptop.  :  a decent device that is well built and powerful. the review is for the laptop version of the 7440 and not the 2-in-1. it's a decent laptop, not the largest of screen sizes but what it lacks in size, it packs in power and functionality. backlit keyboard is nice and responsive, the ir webcam is quick and picks up facial recognition really well and is obviously windows hello ready. the laptop also has fingerprint recognition capabilities but i haven't tested it. the screen is good and looks like it has some sort of anti-reflective film which drastically reduces glare and really usable in sunny or bright light areas. the speakers are fantastic, great sound and where they are positioned on either side, you do get the sense of some surround sound but don't expect it to be 5.1 or 7.1, these are still speakers built into a laptop with little depth, but you could easily do without headphones when listening to music or watching video content. the weight is fine and it isn't the thinnest of laptops but that does mean you do get more than just 2 usb-c ports, you get hdmi & standard usb ports, which is great because you don't have to carry around a portable docking station for extra ports. there is one thing that i don't like much but think it was built by design. when you open the lid and fold it back beyond the upright 90 degree's the bottom of the lid pushes down on the flat surface which gives a little lift to the keyboard, which is a nice touch for those that like some elevation of their keyboard. the downside to this is that the edge of the monitor scraps the surface as you are rotate the screen and therefore could damage the edge if the surface isn't flat and smooth or clean. i also took the opportunity to play some games as well, just to see how well it faired without a dedicated gpu. played fornite and it was a little stuttery with the settings at near high quality, reduced it down to mid-level visual quality and it was very playable. not advocating that this laptop is in anyway a gaming laptop because it isn't, i was purely demostrating the capabilities of this laptop.\n",

Dell Latitude 7440 Rating we have have no issue with the Dell Latitude 7440 thus far . we have be able to put they in the hand of our user with our standard image with no issue , great standard for business . very nice standard machine . Compact & Lightweight Nice and small - size be perfect and lightweight Latitude 7440 Review for business user love the feel and weight of the laptop but the processor seem a bit slow than I expect . nice laptop with good feature I have not use it for very long and it be replace an old XPS13 . so far it perform well and the additional inch in the screen be nice . have the power button in the normal keyboard field be go to take some time to become accustomed to . I use the laptop connect to a docking station and would like to have usb - c port on both side of the laptop . with they only on the left the dock cable have to run around to the far side and the Dell dock cable be short . it be troublesome but less so than change to have the laptop on the righthand side of the desktop monitor . the speaker work pretty well . I like the placement so stereo sound be effective . the camera be pretty wide angled and have a good image . its clunki than my 7200 model , but otherwise good its clunki than my 7200 model , but otherwise good great machine but require much configuration excellent performance . initial setup be abysmal however . BIOS be all screw up and require siginficant configuration before the laptop would boot into auto setup mode for Windows . the default mouse setting be far too sensitive . in general the default configuration for setting be way too conservative and thus far too much time be spend get the laptop into a real world usable configuration . nice Blue , Nice Weight new blue color look nice , ultralight model offer noticeable weight reduction , but not by a lot sleek & Powerful Product be sleek and great performance . very convenient for day to day work style . highly recommend laptop work great . we need a solid laptop for the field that have 5 g. this tick every box . we also purchase the dock which work great as well . so far so good . so far we have have great result with this laptop . it seem Dell have iron out some of the ssd and driver issue with the past couple of generation . Bluetooth the Bluetooth sometimes do not work or will connect to the device but not for the audio but other than that I love it ! mouse and Power off button Speed and memory power excellent . but the mouse sensitivity be too fast , and the function to slow it down do not work . also the off power button next to the delete button be ridiculous ! latitude 7440 good laptop but battery do not last long . not good for travel . good product for executive people 's . the review detail be as follow with rating out of 10 . design - 8 Hardware - 10 Ports - 8 display - 9 performance - 9 Battery - 9 webcam - 9 audio - 9 overall the product be good with a rating of 8 out of 10 and the price of value be 7 out of 10 . window 11p tough network start up with window 11p big step major change on design and material Latitude 7440 Laptop review sleek design , enhance webcam . hopefully the processor and RAM ensure smooth multitasking . okay the product be okay first few week .. once you open excel ... it hang and hang ... too slow to respond .. main reason for directly ftom Dell site be the quality of the product .. I think , it be a wrong choice .. latitude 7440 Laptop fit client need perfectly Latitude 7440 the weight and feature of the device be pleasant and align with other modern spec for pc . the camera quality , while nice to include IR compatibility with Windows Hello , still feel like a \" laptop camera \" instead of a true \" webcam \" . low light performance be still limited and it would be nice to see a 4 k upgrade . the weight of the laptop make it extremely portable ; however , the plastic material make it also feel flimsy , as if carry it loftily from a desk to a couch would risk break it if not fully support with both hand or grip by the spine instead of an edge . the screen look good and do not seem to contribute much to eye fatigue and the keyboard and trackpad seem appropriately responsive . boot up time be quick , as expect , and perform standard productivity workflow like web browsing , document editing , and video conferencing be smooth without noticable interference from the hardware . the available security feature for enterprise - level management seem broad , although I have not fully explore those yet . altogether this be a nice daily - driver that can fit a variety of standard workload and workflow . great performance and design great performance and design a decent device that be well build and powerful . the review be for the laptop version of the 7440 and not the 2 - in-1 . it be a decent laptop , not the large of screen size but what it lack in size , it pack in power and functionality . backlit keyboard be nice and responsive , the IR webcam be quick and pick up facial recognition really well and be obviously Windows hello ready . the laptop also have fingerprint recognition capability but I have not test it . the screen be good and look like it have some sort of anti - reflective film which drastically reduce glare and really usable in sunny or bright light area . the speaker be fantastic , great sound and where they be position on either side , you do get the sense of some surround sound but do not expect it to be 5.1 or 7.1 , these be still speaker build into a laptop with little depth , but you could easily do without headphone when listen to music or watch video content . the weight be fine and it be not the thin of laptop but that do mean you do get more than just 2 usb - c port , you get HDMI & standard USB port , which be great because you do not have to carry around a portable docking station for extra port . there be one thing that I do not like much but think it be build by design . when you open the lid and fold it back beyond the upright 90 degree be the bottom of the lid push down on the flat surface which give a little lift to the keyboard , which be a nice touch for those that like some elevation of their keyboard . the downside to this be that the edge of the monitor scrap the surface as you be rotate the screen and therefore could damage the edge if the surface be not flat and smooth or clean . I also take the opportunity to play some game as well , just to see how well it fair without a dedicated GPU . Played Fornite and it be a little stuttery with the setting at near high quality , reduce it down to mid - level visual quality and it be very playable . not advocate that this laptop be in anyway a gaming laptop because it be not , I be purely demostrate the capability of this laptop . Dell Latitude 7440 XCTO review Computer receive in good order and work fine after set up . latitude 7440 - impressive impressive laptop , fairly thin , lightweight and very capable machine . this be a workhorse of a laptop which we intend to use for the majority of our business need outside of engineer Great Improvement from the old model ... sleek look and fast performance . the touch pad be great . it have a very good screen . on the whole , a very happy experience . excellent product great product , work well but bit heavy to carry around Dell Review Overall , I do really like the laptop and happy I go with a Dell vs Mac this time . I do wish they offer a touchscreen for the price I pay . also , do have some lag to it when I be multitaske . good business laptop with familiarity of previous model Nice light laptop no info of new feature so not sure of what to look for with the upgrade outside the usual battery and speed . seem to be a smooth transition from one to the other and very familiar but modern . Great Fit Works exactly as expect . great laptop with a questionable touch pad these be great laptop , and they recently add a second usb - a connector which be a massive improvement ( ONE be ridiculous ) . the only issue be for some reason the track pad button do not appear to work 100 % of the time - more like 90 - 95 % , which be sufficient to make you think they be good enough to use and just bad enough to be incredibly annoying . reasonably light , reasonably small , and more than powerful enough for the vast majority of user . use a Bluetooth mouse and the button issue become a nothing - burger . perfect in business category good performance , little bit design be disappoint speedy performance machine , could use a big screen and well speaker this laptop be build very well and sturdy . it be lightweight and easy to carry around . the key be relatively quiet . the performance be speedy and there be no delay throughout the day . the camera be up to date and crystal clear . sound level of the speaker could be high , but still decent for a laptop . screen size be a bit on the tiny side , but do work well and look good . Great Business Laptop the device work great . only reason to not give it 5 star be the weight . Punch Small , compact , but throw a good punch . you will look like a corporate drone . but it get the job do . perfectly fine , but not very exciting . everything be functional but just average . surprisingly heavily . great professional laptop great professional laptop . this thing be thin and light weight but also do not get hot . perfect lightweight laptop really nice lightweight laptop capable of 32 gb internal memory for business user run Bloomberg and multiple Excel sheet with ease . the computer for engineering school , I hope that this computer will be what I need for aerospace engineering ! look promise you ! very good small , light , and powerful Slim & Sleek look very sleek , however , they have not be use yet . quality of build & Dell Migrate tool great find the build quality very good . use the Dell Migrate tool and go well easy order and setup easy order process and easy setup . I be glad to have this up and run fo . sleek lightweight powerhouse nice little computer . come load with a Microsoft office suite all set up which be nice . I still need to transfer my various software over to it . very sleek and lightweight . I like the backlit key . dfbdfd the po process can be make easy one of the good work computer make by Dell ; more power efficient processor make the hardware even well nice laptop , good weight and sturdiness . the keyboard and touchpad be some of the good Dell have make yet . I wish there be a more affordable option for a high - resolution screen , but I be sure that will come . price be good for what you get and the battery life be pretty great . Most of our user can get 6 - 8 hour without charge from a new device . obviously that will get short over time , but it be a good starting point . a lot of this be make possible by the new 13 - generation Intel processor , which be finally , FINALLY get to a point where they be not cause heat issue and fan run constantly . if Intel continue to have their processor follow a less power - hungry model , this will only improve . latitude 7440 I purchase a Dell Latitude 7440 about 2 week ago after look at many laptop but decide to purchase online for simplicity and it be deliver within 3 day as state . easy to setup straight out of the box but it have take I a little while to get use to the new window layout . all in all its a great little pc , solid and fast , it do everything I want in a travel laptop . good build quality , small enough to fit in a backpack but powerful enough to do workshop presentation , spreadsheet or stream a movie . I be not sure about not have a network connection build in or if I could plug in all my accessory but so far I have have no problem and once I get everything copy across I have not look back . my big problem be I now have to update all my other accessory to match the new pc . it be only early day but I be feel confident as it come with a 3 year warranty . good lightweight business - grade laptop let down by some of the include Dell business software . the laptop build be solid and thermal\\heat management be pretty good also . the only reason why I do not give it a 5 star rating be some of the software component that need improvement , specifically the Dell Optimiser application that come with the laptop . I try use it for about 2 week and it be quite buggy with regard to auto - monitoring the quality video\\audio conferencing call and the \" on - looker \" detection functionality . it need improvement and I have disable that functionality for now . lightweight , portable with all necessary port . the usb c port need to be recede into the bevel to keep it from move and become wobbly . this be the main point of failure for these when use docking station . lightweight and low heat generate , very impressive . the usb c port need to be recede into the bevel to keep it from move and become wobbly . this be the main point of failure for these when use docking station . Great Business Machine ! the large trackpad take some getting use to come from the 7290 , but this unit be fast and a great upgrade Dell 7440 review our company be consider switch over to Dell laptop from a different brand . so far , we have be impress with the build quality and overall feature of the laptop . so far , the 2 big \" complaint \" have be the separation , or lack of separation , of the backspace and enter key and the wide angle view of the integrate camera . both be minor , and if these be the thing that user be share for feedback , I would say that this be a great machine . Dell latitude 7440 XCTO nice size . great screen quality . login proctection be good . only downside be there be no privacy screen nor an easy way to print screen . ergonomic review USB - c port and hdmi port all on the left side of the laptop , not convenient DELL vs MAC this be a very nice beefy machine . it be very comparable to the MacBook . Good Product but a step backwards in feel . functionality and speed be excellent . the negative be that this device no long have a premium feel without the carbon fiber and feel like the same plastic product you get with a 5440 . latitude 7440 - another Dell success story ( thus far ) nicely design frame , sleek and solid , very contemporary . high - contrast screen make interaction a breeze , even after hour of continual use . solid touch - response from the keyboard . processing power ( thus far ) be substantial , with good performance rating across a number of benchmark app . typical complete suite of supportive tool and feature that promise to provide reduce start - up time , increase battery life and help to prioritize functionality of oft - use app . security feature be well design for the typical office environment , with the ability to grey - out the screen if the system notice someone look over your shoulder . evaluation continue ; no notable deficiency find thus far . this appear to be another quality Dell product , thus far . more durable much well than the 5xxx series , the aluminum shell seem more durable , I have so many scratch laptop from the 53xx and 54xx series that I can not reuse they . I be hope the case on the 7440 be long last for our Green - IT initiative . no surprise in a good way do everything we need it to . Laptop Review Super laptop , fast . bit of trouble with camera cause window crash but the new bio and camera software fix the problem . fast and lightweight fast , lightweight , run cool . great Machine the battery life on this device be awesome . I do not have to worry about plug it in every couple of hour . use the 2 - 1 with the Dell Pen be great for take note . my only negative be it be a little heavy to carry around and work on for more than 30ish minute . high performing , light - weight system the Dell Latitude 7440 be tremendously responsive , deliver great performance in a light - weight package . very nice very nice . only negative be all the crap ware that come pre instal . Dell always need an option to get a clean machine . at least it do not have Norton ! great Laptop ! great laptop that I use to work from home . screen size be perfect and love the flexibility to move around the house without drop wifi . the only minor issue be for about a month , it would blue screen every so often ( once every couple of week ) but that seem to be resolve after apply update . I get a lot of use out of this laptop and would recommend it . fast , light and quick laptop if fast , light and feel durable . I like the old model case well though . not as good as last Dell purchase Less than happy with with the individual that I buy this through , now have frustartion with tech support User Friendly Very user friendly . love it need memory to function like a workstation pc come with 16 GB of memory and to be honest , it quickly cause lag on the box . I have a lot of open tab for the internet and I have to do a lot of closing of app and tab to work . do not work not happy with latitude 7040 . also doke station thunder bolt do not work with the laptop Great Laptop great choice for laptop upgrade for office work do not want to quit the standby mode my computer work well except it do not want to resume a session after be in stand by mode . I need to turn it off completely before I can use it again . other wise , it be easy to use , nice looking and I enjoy also window 11 that be new to I . just fine ! its a dependable machine . Dell Latitude 7440 XCTO little flimsy and less port . screen be not very crisp . the touch screen be show some issue right from the box Potential Exec laptop replacement this laptop be * light * , very very light . which be great from a portability standpoint . we have not have quite long enough to fully judge it be use case regard the battery life or the software load from our company . but I can say that this would likely be a wonderful laptop for support personnel that often travel . I would caution against hand this to any executive that be look for a \" polished \" machine in regard to the body type . the screen have a bit of flex when close ; not enough to be any concern , but noteworthy . portable vs traditional Device be slim and portable . east to setup . speaker and microphone quality be good for a single user but not good use in a meeting setting . rear camera work well but front face camera be not do not work . not an improvement over the same version from 4 year ago no improvement from the 2019 version of the 7400 , hate the mousepad and button be integrate into a single pad and not separate button , the large mousepad make it difficult to type on the keyboard , and an old / slow CPU be actually a downgrade the laptop be great but order process go wrong . the purchasing process be very incovenient this time since Dell have to cancel my original po after few day for some internal issue . then I have to reorder the laptop again . it create extra work for I and IT team as well as delay my order . product come with faulty display Product come with faulty display Unleashing Productivity On - the - go with the Latitude 7440 the Latitude 7440 have prove to be an invaluable tool for my daily work . its compact size , combine with its lightweight design , make it incredibly convenient to carry around , be it in meeting within the office or for on - the - go task outside . I have be particularly impressed with its battery life , which consistently see I through an entire workday without the need for a recharge . this have be a game - changer for I , allow uninterrupted work session both in and out of the office . for those in search of a reliable and portable work companion , the Latitude 7440 be a commendable choice . good for entertainment instead of business use sound : speaker on both side of keyboard panel be awesome . power button : fingerprint recognition be not sensitive Button : Pg down and pg up button too near , keep press on the wrong one . Button : Delete and Power button too near , keep press on the wrong one . wi - Fi card : faulty after 1 week of receive the new laptop and need to be replace with a new one . so so experience with intial use . I have all sort of trouble with get software instal ( e.g. multiple instance of the Blue Screen of death ) and sort through hardward issue ( e.g. , camera working and microphone quality ) .. BIOS Problem I need to use an external keyboard to access f2 or F12 Nice laptop , Windows software keep crash Software arrive defective lightweight and powerful , but do not play nicely with multiple monitor . the laptop be lightweight and powerful , but will not play nicely with Dell wd19 dock with multiple 4k monitor . no EVO Framework I purchase this laptop for personal use because the website filter identify this computer as EVO and VPRO certify . I also call the sale team numerous time and also use the Chat function with the Sale Department , verify that this laptop be EVO . EVO certification be important to I because it indicate a well perform laptop and overall computing experience . I be disappoint that I find out that this laptop be not EVO certify and I will be return it for another one . I have be use Dell product for over a decade and I have be very satisfied with Dell and I would recommend Dell to my friend and family . however , in my particular situation , I be tell that I would get a 15 % restocking fee if I return the laptop . I have be work with management and I hope this be not the case . the laptop be good and the 36 GB make easy work of my statistical software . if it be EVO certify , like my previous Latitude 7420 model , this would be the perfect business / travel laptop . the device be faulty and face issue in usage . the device be faulty and face issue in usage . device be crash with blue screen of death with different reason . waste of Money Worst Screen Quality ever on any laptop Dell latitude-14 - 7440 - 2 - in-1 - laptop significant downgrade in material quality compare to the previous version 7400 . some part be show design flow from new . please see the picture after use of 1 week from new . too slow ! wait 5 week for the computer . way too slow ! solid corporate device this be a great perform device for corporate usage many complication I receive my new dell and it come with many complication and I still can not use it .... software update would not load up , program refuse to fully download on the computer that I need for my job .. and my job 's IT dept have be work on it for two week now in order to make it a functional computer that I can rely on use . hate to put a bad review but this be the truth dead on arrival we have not have good luck with our 7440 s with so far 2 of 10 with fail usbc port where the motherboard have to be replace . good device - poor screen and touch support the device be fast and responsive to most office application . it have a solid feel however it be a little heavy than I have expect . I be most disappointed with the touch screen . the clamshell model I have only provide basic touch support and do not support active pen(s ) . base on the high unit price and poor touch screen support , I struggle to recommend this unit . rather keep the old Latitude laptop everything seem to lag when type from email , type in Excel , Word , Teams . hate this new laptop Need User manual please send I User Manual for this device , I need to learn to fully utilize the feature Sr . Director of IT Business Service I be very pleased with the laptop as it meet my requirement . fast , lightweight . blue screen not a good experience , have be get the ' blue screen of death ' since last night and do not allow I to login even after multiple restart I do not have it yet . I do not have it yet . shipping take forever . PDP error the product description website have a bug , for which customer will end up pay for . half the stuff have not arrive . half the stuff have not arrive . first time in 25 year dispaointe with a Dell very disapointed with the quality of the new Latitude laptop . a step backword in the design receive a wrong configuration receive a wrong configuration laptop and response be so mean from the sale representative . not sure if this get resolve . horrible Customer Support never deliver and asian order support just keep say it be deliver act like they do not understand and want to put ticket in resolve . no help at all . still unresolve many day later . lose in transit and no refund 10 day since I order and no laptop . dhl say that they can not find it . Dell keep say it be be investigate , probably use my money that have not be refund . can not log in unable to log in . have be with my IT department for over 2 week now . still can not use Great Laptops , but Quality Control have slip order 2 laptop , 1 be DOA upon delivery . unfortunately this be not unique - last order be for 9 laptop , 2 be DOA . something have seriously go wrong with Quality Control in the factory . good news be that Dell Pro Support fix they without any issue - once part be available which take a week in each case . other than that , love these laptop . faulty motherboard Dell send I a laptop with a faulty motherboard dead on arrival Laptop dead on arrival , still wait on a replacement . Bad Quality Bad Quality , overheating , and keyboard / trackpad issue . hassle with installation of Win 11 Laptop do not come with the require security software as require by my company Broken Device laptop be break and Customer Support be not helpful\n"
